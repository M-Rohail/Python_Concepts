# Create a program to find the area of a right angled triangle.

# The area of a right angled triangle is given by:

# area = 1/2 * base * height
# Take two float inputs for base and height variables.
# Calculate the area of the triangle using the given formula and assign it to area.
# Print the value of area.

base = float(input("Enter the base :"))
height = float(input("Enter the height :"))
area = 1/2*base*height
print(area)
