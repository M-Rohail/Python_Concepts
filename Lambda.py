# Create a lambda function that returns the square of a number passed as an argument.

# Create the lambda function and assign it to a variable named square.
# Take a float input from the user and assign it to the number variable.
# Call the lambda function with number as an argument and print the result.


# number = float(input("Enter the no:"))
# def squ(n): return n**2


# print(squ(number))

# Create a lambda function that takes two arguments and returns their sum.

# Create the lambda function and assign it to a variable named add.
# Take two integer inputs and assign them to n1 and n2 respectively.
# Call the lambda function with n1 and n2 as arguments and print the result.
n1 = int(input("Enter the no:"))
n2 = int(input("Enter the no"))
