# Create a program to find the average of three numbers entered by the user.

# The average of 3 numbers a, b, and c is given by:

# average = (a + b + c) / 3
# Take float input for three variables number1, number2, and number3.
# Calculate the average using the formula and print it.

number1 = float(input("Enter the no:"))
number2 = float(input("Enter the no:"))
number3 = float(input("Enter the no:"))
average = (number1+number2+number3)/3
print(average)
